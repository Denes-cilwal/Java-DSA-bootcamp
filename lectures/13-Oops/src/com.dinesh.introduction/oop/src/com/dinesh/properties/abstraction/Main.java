 -  Abstraction is solving design level issue (Abstraction provides some outer methods only providing valuable information)
 -  Encapsulation is solving implementation (now what that outer methods implement internally is preserved by encapsulation)

 -   Encapsulation focus on internal working , Abstraction focus on external stuffs
 -   abstraction is achieved by abstract methods[will cover later], things visible to me
 -    Abstraction is process of gaining information but encapsulation is process of  containing information
