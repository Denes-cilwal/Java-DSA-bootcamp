/*
Complexity Analysis of Binary Search
Since analysis starts with the middle element, in the best case, itâ€™s possible that the middle element of the array itself is the target element.
Otherwise, the length of the array is halved.
In the following iterations, the size of the sub array is reduced using the result of the previous comparison.

Initial length of array =n
Iteration 1 - Length of array =  n / 2
Iteration 2 - Length of array = n / 4
Iteration k - Length of array =  n /2 power K


After k iterations, the size of the array becomes 1 (narrowed down to the first element or last element only)

Length of array =  n/ 2^k =  1
n =  2 ^ k
// log on both sides
k = log2(N) ==> log(N)

/*
Imagine we're trying to
find a number within a large sorted array that spans almost the entire 32-bit positive integer range.
 Let's consider our search range's start and end are as follows:


int start = 1073741823;   // Slightly less than half of 2^31 - 1
int end = 2147483647;    // 2^31 - 1, the maximum for a 32-bit signed integer
Now, when you try to find the midpoint using:


int mid = (start + end) / 2;
The expression (start + end) results in 3211226470, which exceeds the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer (2147483647). This will cause an integer overflow.
